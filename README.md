in mathematics, superperfect numbers are numbers matching the following criteria:
sum of dividers of n is d and sum of dividers of d is n*2.
to make an example, 4 is a superperfect number, as 4's dividers are 1,2,4. 1+2+4= 7, and 7's dividers are 1,7. notice as 1+7=8 (4*2)
in short, 4 => 1+2+4= 7 => 1+7 = 8 = 4*2.

task: write a code to find all the superperfect numbers from 1 to x (code should provide explanation) in any language you prefer
